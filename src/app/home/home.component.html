      <p>What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you. Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead? You're taller than you look in the tabIoids, Mr. Wayne. You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life. When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service. And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction. Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha. And I thought my jokes were bad. I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I got another another job. Your. You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting. There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf! This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city. I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil. How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da! A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid. Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books. Search him. Then I will kill you. You know how to disappear. We can teach you to become truly invisible. Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. You must become more than just a man in the mind of you opponent. No guns, no killing. It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American. Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud. Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment. Perhaps you should read the instructions first? If you're good at something, never do it for free. Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I'll see him again. I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality. You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade. I'm Batman Didn't you get the memo? Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane. I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members in the Wayne family. You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth. It was a dog. It was a big dog. It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman. The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act. This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better. Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid. It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it. My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows. Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not... I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir. Very well. Death! By exile. Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See? I am the League of Shadows. I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world. Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us. I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman. If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion." I thought this might be a good opportunity for... improving the foundations. You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline. You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city. Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent. No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne. Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future. You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin. My anger outweights my guilt. Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad. I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital. This isn't a car. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ? You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling. But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you. Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. As Gotham's favored son you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality. You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Do you feel in charge? Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile. It will be extremely painful... for you It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan. All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones.  Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea. Gordon... You do like to play things pretty close to the chest. There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back. Bane was a member of the League of Shadows. And then he was excommunicated. And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul, is not to be trifled with. Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting. Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear. Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up. Do I really look like a guy with a plan? Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear? The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them. Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have languished under the name of this man: Harvey Dent. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?</p>
